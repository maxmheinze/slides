  abstract  = {Topographic variation underpins a myriad of patterns and processes in hydrology, climatology, geography and ecology and is key to understanding the variation of life on the planet. A fully standardized and global multivariate product of different terrain features has the potential to support many large-scale research applications, however to date, such datasets are unavailable. Here we used the digital elevation model products of global 250{\hspace{0.167em}}m GMTED2010 and near-global 90{\hspace{0.167em}}m SRTM4.1dev to derive a suite of topographic variables: elevation, slope, aspect, eastness, northness, roughness, terrain roughness index, topographic position index, vector ruggedness measure, profile/tangential curvature, first/second order partial derivative, and 10 geomorphological landform classes. We aggregated each variable to 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100{\hspace{0.167em}}km spatial grains using several aggregation approaches. While a cross-correlation underlines the high similarity of many variables, a more detailed view in four mountain regions reveals local differences, as well as scale variations in the aggregated variables at different spatial grains. All newly-developed variables are available for download at Data Citation 1 and for download and visualization at http://www.earthenv.org/topography.},

	abstract = {Gold mining is extremely valuable for countries involved in it due to the potential for employment, income allocation and socio-economic development. As a result of the attraction of international investors by governments of countries rich in this natural resource and increasing gold prices, large-scale, small-scale and unlicensed and illegal (Galamsey) mining activities are expanding. This expansion can have significant effects on the environment, such as pollution and altering the hydrological regime, constituting a threat to the natural ecosystems and the health of the populace staying in gold mining zones. This research focuses on the evaluation of the effects of different types of soil reclamation measures used by large-scale, small-scale and galamsey miners on hydrological components and sediment yield in the Pra River Basin (PRB), Ghana, using the Soil and Water Analysis Tool (SWAT). Soil samples were collected from the reclaimed sites of the three mining types, analyzed and used as input into the SWAT model to assess their effect on the hydrological components and sediment yield. The results showed that apart from the first two soil layers of large scale, almost all the three mining types have a significant change in the reclaimed soil constituents of various layers of the soil. The trend and magnitude of post-reclamation impact on hydrological components from galamsey and small-scale mining are almost the same. With reference to the natural background, galamsey and small-scale activity, respectively, increased surface runoff by 51.5 {\%} and 43.9 {\%}, and reduced baseflow by 24.4 {\%} and 22.9 {\%}, while large-scale activity depicted the decrease in runoff and increase in baseflow. Sediment yield from all the three types of gold mining increased significantly. In the PRB, galamsey prominently produced much sediment (161.9 ton/year), followed by small-scale (151.1 ton/year) and large-scale (67.5 ton/year). This paper identified that the effects of land degradation linked to mining cannot be attributed only to galamsey but also to small-scale and large-scale mining. From the outcomes, special attention should be given to reclamation and water management activities that can solve emerging regulatory and environmental management problems that are being encountered by the mining sector.

Since the release of the first {\textquotedblleft}WoSIS snapshot{\textquotedblright}, in July 2016, many new soil data were shared with us, registered in the ISRIC data repository and subsequently standardised in accordance with the licences specified by the data providers. Soil profile data managed in WoSIS were contributed by a wide range of data providers; therefore, special attention was paid to measures for soil data quality and the standardisation of soil property definitions, soil property values (and units of measurement) and soil analytical method descriptions. We presently consider the following soil chemical properties: organic carbon, total carbon, total carbonate equivalent, total nitrogen, phosphorus (extractable P, total P and P retention), soil pH, cation exchange capacity and electrical conductivity. We also consider the following physical properties: soil texture (sand, silt, and clay), bulk density, coarse fragments and water retention. Both of these sets of properties are grouped according to analytical procedures that are operationally comparable. Further, for each profile we provide the original soil classification (FAO, WRB, USDA), version and horizon designations, insofar as these have been specified in the source databases. Measures for geographical accuracy (i.e. location) of the point data, as well as a first approximation for the uncertainty associated with the operationally defined analytical methods, are presented for possible consideration in digital soil mapping and subsequent earth system modelling. The latest (dynamic) set of quality-assessed and standardised data, called {\textquotedblleft}wosis{$\_$}latest{\textquotedblright}, is freely accessible via an OGC-compliant WFS (web feature service). For consistent referencing, we also provide time-specific static {\textquotedblleft}snapshots{\textquotedblright}. The present snapshot (September 2019) is comprised of 197{\hspace{0.167em}}498 geo-referenced profiles originating from 173 countries. They represent over 832{\hspace{0.167em}}000 soil layers (or horizons) and over 5.8 million records. The actual number of observations for each property varies (greatly) between profiles and with depth, generally depending on the objectives of the initial soil sampling programmes. In the coming years, we aim to fill gradually gaps in the geographic distribution and soil property data themselves, this subject to the sharing of a wider selection of soil profile data for so far under-represented areas and properties by our existing and prospective partners. Part of this work is foreseen in conjunction within the Global Soil Information System (GloSIS) being developed by the Global Soil Partnership (GSP). The {\textquotedblleft}WoSIS snapshot {\textendash} September 2019{\textquotedblright} is archived and freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.17027/isric-wdcsoils.20190901 (Batjes et al., 2019).},

The explicit inclusion of beneficiaries makes values intrinsic to ecosystem services; whether or not those values are monetized, the ecosystem services framework provides a way to assess trade-offs among alternative scenarios of resource use and land- and seascape change. We provide an overview of the ecosystem functions responsible for producing terrestrial hydrologic services and use this context to lay out a blueprint for a more general ecosystem service assessment. Other ecosystem services are addressed in our discussion of scale and trade-offs. We review valuation and policy tools useful for ecosystem service protection and provide several examples of land management using these tools. Throughout, we highlight avenues for research to advance the ecosystem services framework as an operational basis for policy decisions.},

Most of these effects are driven by fewer deaths occurring within one month of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure is a potential pathophysiologic mechanism. The analysis also reveals nonlinear effects of TSPs pollution and greater sensitivity of black infant mortality at the county level. Importantly, the estimates are stable across a variety of specifications.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods{---}random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression{---}as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10{\textendash}fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56{\%} (coarse fragments) and 83{\%} (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61{\%}. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230{\%}. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base License.},

Here we address one of the most important missing components in the current ecosystem services toolbox: a comprehensive and generalizable framework for describing and valuing water quality-related services. Water quality is often misrepresented as a final ecosystem service. We argue that it is actually an important contributor to many different services, from recreation to human health. We present a valuation approach for water quality-related services that is sensitive to different actions that affect water quality, identifies aquatic endpoints where the consequences of changing water quality on human well-being are realized, and recognizes the unique groups of beneficiaries affected by those changes. We describe the multiple biophysical and economic pathways that link actions to changes in water quality-related ecosystem goods and services and provide guidance to researchers interested in valuing these changes. Finally, we present a valuation template that integrates biophysical and economic models, links actions to changes in service provision and value estimates, and considers multiple sources of water quality-related ecosystem service values without double counting.},

We then used process-based and empirically tested modeling to produce a global assessment of metal mining contamination in river systems and the numbers of human populations and livestock exposed. Worldwide, metal mines affect 479,200 kilometers of river channels and 164,000 square kilometers of floodplains. The number of people exposed to contamination sourced from long-term discharge of mining waste into rivers is almost 50 times greater than the number directly affected by tailings dam failures.}

	abstract = {Context Soil acidification poses a severe threat to both global food security and sustainable agriculture. However, a quantitative assessment of its impact on crop yield reduction across different soil conditions and crop varieties is still lacking. Objectives This study aims to evaluate how soil acidification affects crop yields, root length, crop nutrient uptake, soil nutrients availability, soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen, and soil microbial biomass phosphorus. Additionally, key factors contributing to yield reduction were identified through random forest model. Methods A meta-analysis was conducted, involving 1760 observations from 101 peer-reviewed studies. Results Soil acidification led to an average yield reduction of 13.7 {\%}. Among crops, vegetables are most sensitive to soil acidification, with a reduction in yield of 33 {\%}, while maize and wheat yields decrease by 18.2 {\%} and 18.3 {\%}, respectively. The yield of rice is unaffected by soil acidification. Similarly, in the present study, the yield of leguminous crops is also not affected by soil acidification because the soil pH mainly studied for leguminous crops is slightly acidic (pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.0). Additionally, soil acidification results in a 25.4 {\%} reduction in root length and a 3.1 {\%}-13.6 {\%} decrease in nutrient uptake (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium). The soil total nitrogen content, available phosphorus, soil organic matter, and exchangeable calcium were observed to decrease by 11.4 {\%}, 18.1 {\%}, 16.3 {\%}, and 76.8 {\%}, respectively, as affected by soil acidification. The microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus decreased with pH reduction. The inhibitory effect of acidification on crop yield showed a decreasing and then increasing trend along with the elevated soil organic matter. Quantitative analysis revealed that yield was not inhibited by acidification within a soil pH range of 6.03{\textendash}6.85. Specifically, for maize and wheat, this range that ensured crops yield was between 6.3 and 7.4, while yields of vegetable crops showed a reduction following soil acidification across all tested pH levels. The random forest prediction model indicates that the annual average rainfall is the main factor affecting the reduction of crop yields due to soil acidification. Conclusion Severe soil acidification can significantly impede crop yields, especially for vegetables, maize, and wheat. The decline in yield is attributed to the inhibition of root development, and reduced effectiveness of soil nutrients caused by acidification. Implications The findings provide crucial insights for global strategies aimed at managing acidic soils. It is recommended that soil pH should be maintained near the optimal acidity levels for specific crops to enhance crop yields and ensure global food security.

	abstract = {Aluminum (Al) toxicity in acid soils is a significant limitation to crop production worldwide, as approximately 50{\%} of the world's potentially arable soil is acidic. Because acid soils are such an important constraint to agriculture, understanding the mechanisms and genes conferring resistance to Al toxicity has been a focus of intense research interest in the decade since the last article on crop acid soil tolerance was published in this journal. An impressive amount of progress has been made during that time that has greatly increased our understanding of the diversity of Al resistance genes and mechanisms, how resistance gene expression is regulated and triggered by Al and Al-induced signals, and how the proteins encoded by these genes function and are regulated. This review examines the state of our understanding of the physiological, genetic, and molecular bases for crop Al tolerance, looking at the novel Al resistance genes and mechanisms that have been identified over the past ten years. Additionally, it examines how the integration of molecular and genetic analyses of crop Al resistance is starting to be exploited for the improvement of crop plants grown on acid soils via both molecular-assisted breeding and biotechnology approaches.}

The rapid increase in ore extraction brings along pressures on the country{'}s water resources, as mining is a particularly water-intensive activity. However, site-specific data on water input and management are scarce. We propose a methodology for estimating water input in mining at a high geographical resolution. We focus on the three key metals mined in Brazil: iron, aluminum (i.e. bauxite ore), and copper, and derive water input coefficients for all mines from governmental and corporate sources as well as from the literature. We estimate that overall, the sum of the water inputs estimated for Brazilian bauxite, copper, and iron ore mining decreased by 15{\%} from an average of 506.5{$\pm$}62.4 hm3 in 2014 to an average of 408.4{$\pm$}67.2 hm3 in 2017. The regions where most water was appropriated were Northern (Pará state) and Southeast (Minas Gerais) for iron, Northern (Pará) for aluminum, and Northern (Pará) and Central West (Goiás) for copper. We show that there are still significant consistency and data availability gaps, and that further work is still necessary to improve site-specific reporting and open access to data collected by public institutions.},

Adding total damages across all sources yields gross annual damages (GAD) which is a green accounting parallel to gross domestic product (GDP). GAD in 2002 varies between $71 billion and $277 billion (0.7{\textendash}2.8{\%} of GDP). The range of values depends largely on the value of health and the concentration{\textendash}response function relating exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to adult mortality rates. Source location also matters. Urban emissions constitute 52{\%} of total emissions by weight yet they cause nearly three-quarters of the GAD.},

Among the insect species studied, C. forda accumulated nickel significantly higher (70{\textendash}81 {\%}), I. obscura had higher cadmium (2{\textendash}84 {\%}) and lead (10{\textendash}79 {\%}), while I. rubra and M. falciger accumulated higher iron (41{\textendash}96 {\%}) and zinc (1{\textendash}67 {\%}), respectively, than other insect species. The quantity of I. obscura consumed (248 g person{-}1 day{-}1) was significantly higher (9{\textendash}37 {\%}) than other insect species. It was noted that the consumption of insects increased the daily intake of heavy metals, enhanced the target hazard quotient, and increased the associated health risks by up to 9 folds compared to the WHO permissible limits meaning that the daily intake of metals consumed depends on the daily quantity of insects consumed. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of heavy metals along the soil-plant-edible insect-human food chain could pose severe human and environmental health risks along the mining gradients. The potential consequences of heavy metal mobility in the consumer trophic levels and the ecotoxicological consequences are particularly concerning. Furthermore, physiological and biological studies are needed to investigate the abovementioned effects.

  abstract  = {Methods for quantifying the impacts of water use within life cycle assessment have developed significantly over the past decade. These methods account for local differences in hydrology and water use contexts through the use of regionally specific impact characterisation factors. However, few studies have applied these methods to the mining industry and so there is limited understanding regarding how spatial boundaries may affect assessments of the mining industry's consumptive water use impacts. To address this, we developed production weighted characterisation factors for 25 mineral and metal commodities based upon the spatial distribution of global mine production across watersheds and nations. Our results indicate that impact characterisation using the national average {`}Water Stress Index{'} (WSI) would overestimate the water use impacts for 67{\%} of mining operations when compared to assessments using watershed WSI values. Comparatively, national average {`}Available Water Remaining{'} (AWaRe) factors would overestimate impacts for 60{\%} of mining operations compared to assessments using watershed factors. In the absence of watershed scale inventory data, assessments may benefit from developing alternative characterisation factors reflecting the spatial distribution of commodity production across watersheds. The results also provide an indication of the commodities being mined in highly water stressed or scarce regions.

	abstract = {Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) activities continue to grow in many resource-endowed countries with ASM-generated revenues serving as a precursor to socio-economic growth especially in mineral-rich rural communities. However, the rapid proliferation of this extractive activity into new frontiers often extends to territories where, traditionally, agricultural activities may already be present. Considering the destructive effects of the ASM life cycle on the environment, concerns have been raised regarding the negative agricultural impacts of ASM. Thus in this paper, we review the Janus-faced nature of ASM as discourses have developed in the burgeoning literature. Our review reveals an emerging narrative suggesting that in some instances ASM and agriculture complement each other with beneficial consequences. Nevertheless, this highly informal type of mining can have deleterious effects on agriculture through three main mechanisms: land degradation and farm invasions, water and mercury pollution, and the Dutch disease phenomenon {\textendash} the shift of labour from the agriculture sector to the ASM sector. As most of the operations of small-scale mineral extractors take place in rural communities where agriculture is the main source of livelihood, we find the creation of vulnerabilities in the agrarian economy through these mechanisms. Considering the economic importance of the two sectors to livelihoods, stakeholders would need to recast resources policy to ensure the proper accommodation of both sectors especially in the rural economic space.}

  abstract  = {Direct effects of soil or its constituents on human health are through its ingestion, inhalation or absorption. The soil contains many infectious organisms that may enter the human body through these pathways, but it also provides organisms on which our earliest antibiotics are based. Indirect effects of soil arise from the quantity and quality of food that humans consume. Trace elements can have both beneficial and toxic effects on humans, especially where the range for optimal intake is narrow. We focus on four trace elements (iodine, iron, selenium and zinc) whose deficiencies have substantial effects on human health. As the world's population increases issues of food security become more pressing, as does the need to sustain soil fertility and minimize its degradation. Lack of adequate food and food of poor nutritional quality lead to differing degrees of under-nutrition, which in turn causes ill health. Soil and land are finite resources and agricultural land is under severe competition from other uses. Relationships between soil and health are often difficult to extricate because of the many confounding factors present. Nevertheless, recent scientific understanding of soil processes and factors that affect human health are enabling greater insight into the effects of soil on our health. Multidisciplinary research that includes soil science, agronomy, agricultural sustainability, toxicology, epidemiology and the medical sciences will facilitate the discovery of new antibiotics, a greater understanding of how materials added to soil used for food production affect health and deciphering of the complex relationships between soil and human health.},

  abstract  = {Concern has been raised in the scientific literature about the environmental implications of extracting natural gas from deep shale formations, and published studies suggest that shale gas development may affect local groundwater quality. The potential for surface water quality degradation has been discussed in prior work, although no empirical analysis of this issue has been published. The potential for large-scale surface water quality degradation has affected regulatory approaches to shale gas development in some US states, despite the dearth of evidence. This paper conducts a large-scale examination of the extent to which shale gas development activities affect surface water quality. Focusing on the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, we estimate the effect of shale gas wells and the release of treated shale gas waste by permitted treatment facilities on observed downstream concentrations of chloride (Cl{-}) and total suspended solids (TSS), controlling for other factors. Results suggest that (i) the treatment of shale gas waste by treatment plants in a watershed raises downstream Cl{-} concentrations but not TSS concentrations, and (ii) the presence of shale gas wells in a watershed raises downstream TSS concentrations but not Cl{-} concentrations. These results can inform future voluntary measures taken by shale gas operators and policy approaches taken by regulators to protect surface water quality as the scale of this economically important activity increases.},

The former reductionist concept of pollution was of examining individual effects of particular substances on individual taxa or sub-communities in freshwater systems, an essentially ecotoxicological concept. It is now less useful than a more holistic approach that treats the impacts on the system as a whole and includes physical impacts such as drainage and physical modification of river channels and modification of the catchment as well as nutrient, particulate and biocide pollution. The European Water Framework Directive implicitly recognizes this in requiring restoration of water bodies to {`}good ecological quality{'}, which is defined as only slightly different from pristine state.

After controlling for anthropogenic inputs and other landscape factors affecting nutrient transport{---}such as runoff, precipitation, slope, number of reservoirs, irrigated area, and area with subsurface tile drains{---}the relations between export and the area in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) (N) and conservation tillage (P) were positive. Additional interaction terms indicated that the relations between export and the area in conservation tillage (N) and the CRP (P) progressed from being clearly positive when soil erodibility was low or moderate, to being close to zero when soil erodibility was higher, to possibly being slightly negative only at the 90th to 95th percentile of soil erodibility values. Possible explanations for the increase in nutrient export with increased area in management practices include greater transport of soluble nutrients from areas in conservation tillage; lagged response of stream quality to implementation of management practices because of nitrogen transport in groundwater, time for vegetative cover to mature, and/or prior accumulation of P in soils; or limitations in the management practice and stream monitoring data sets. If lags are occurring, current nutrient export from agricultural watersheds may still be reflecting the influence of agricultural land-use practices that were in place before the implementation of these management practices.},

One way to look at land use and related environmental impacts is the concept of ecosystem services (ES), defined as the benefits people derive from services provided by ecosystems. This paper estimates the costs of the reduction of ES due to metal mining{\textasciigrave}s global land use by analysing four key metal ores {\textendash} bauxite (aluminium), copper, gold and iron, and by doing so, provides also novel information from which biomes those metals are extracted. The overall ES cost caused by metal mining is estimated at about USD 5.4 billion/year (2016), with about two thirds in forested areas. If added to prices, it would lead to increases of between 0.8 {\%} and 7.9 {\%} for the four commodities studied. The authors do not understand ES valuation as a market-based, stand-alone tool to lower the land impact of metal mining. Other policy tools would have to play a leading role, such as zoning regulations, environmental minimum standards or closure legislation. However, it would be a useful support for such policy tools in all stages of mining where land use aspects play a role.},

The EU recognizes the need to use a consumption-based (or {`}footprint{'}) perspective to capture the global dimension of resources and their impacts. In this paper, we analyse how the EU{'}s footprints compare to those of other nations, to what extent the EU and other major economies of the world rely on embodied resource imports, and what the implications are for policy making based on this comparison. This study is the first comprehensive multi-indicator comparison of all four policy relevant indicators, and uses a single consistent global Multi-Regional Input Output (MRIO) database with a unique and high level of product detail across countries. We find that Europe is the only region in the world that relies on net embodied imports for all indicators considered. We further find that the powerful economies of China and others in the Asia-Pacific already dominate global resource consumption from a footprint perspective, while they still haven{'}t reached the prosperity of developed countries. Competition for resources is hence likely to increase, making Europe even more vulnerable. A hot spot analysis suggests that final consumption of food, transport and housing are priorities for reduction efforts along the life cycle. Further, countries with a similar Human Development Index can have very different footprints, pointing at societal organisation at macro-level as option for improvement. This points at options for countries for lowering their footprint, becoming less dependent on embodied imports, while maintaining a high quality of life.},

  abstract  = {The largest concentration of isolated indigenous peoples in the world is in the indigenous lands of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. However, the right to self-isolation and the survival of these societies are at risk because powerful interests want to exploit the natural assets of their relatively untouched areas. These ambitions are reflected in a recent bill (PL191/2020), which proposes opening up indigenous lands to mining. We assess the threat imposed by mining to isolated peoples and the indigenous territories they occupy. Specifically, we cross data on mining requests received by the National Mining Agency with information on the distribution of isolated indigenous groups recorded by the Socio-Environmental Institute, in order to evaluate the number and aerial extent of requests for mineral prospecting and operation registered in indigenous lands with isolated groups. We also analyze whether mining requests are related to the presence of isolated groups, the state of knowledge about them, and the current existence of illegal mining operations. Our results indicate that, even though mining is not yet allowed in indigenous lands, mining companies are very active in the search for exploitable areas in these territories. If bill PL191/2020 passes, mining operations would affect more than 10 million hectares in 25 indigenous lands in the Legal Amazon region that are home to 43 isolated groups. We found that the situation is especially worrisome for 21 isolated groups whose lands concentrate 97{\%} of all mining requests. Mineral-rich areas overlap remote areas where more indigenous peoples persist in isolation, so that mining requests are significantly related to the presence of isolated groups. Nonetheless, we show that companies are hesitant to invest in lands with well-known isolated groups that could impede the licensing process and pose reputational risks to the companies. Brazil's mechanisms for environmental and indigenous protection have been dismantled by the current presidential administration and offer no guarantees for a safe coexistence between extractive operations and isolated peoples. Thus, the approval of bill PL191/2020 could lead to undesired contact and the extinction of a large number of unique peoples, societies and cultures.},

  abstract  = {Travel time to cities in 2015 is quantified in a high-resolution global map that will be useful for socio-economic policy design and conservation research. Resources that sustain human wellbeing, such as education, jobs and health services, are distributed unequally, with higher concentrations in dense urban areas. Increasing access to such opportunities and services is a key factor in the advancement of fair and sustainable development. Integrating multiple large data sources for road and city geography, Daniel Weiss and colleagues have created a high-resolution global map that quantifies travel time to cities in the year 2015. This map provides a detailed view of the heterogeneity in accessibility to cities around the world, serving not just as a potential indicator for development but also as an input for future models in areas such as conservation biology. The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of {`}leaving no one behind{'} established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations1. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago2, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9{\%} of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7{\%} of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.},

  abstract = {Mining activities induce profound changes to societies and the environment they inhabit. With global extraction of metal ores doubling over the past two decades, pressures related to mining have dramatically increased. In this paper, we explore where growing global metal extraction has particularly taken effect. Using fine-grain data, we investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of mining of nine metal ores (bauxite, copper, gold, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, silver and zinc) across approximately 3,000 sites of extraction worldwide between 2000 and 2019. To approach the related environmental implications, we intersect mining sites with terrestrial biomes, protected areas, and watersheds categorised by water availability. We find that 79{\%} of global metal ore extraction in 2019 originated from five of the six most species-rich biomes, with mining volumes doubling since 2000 in tropical moist forest ecosystems. We also find that half of global metal ore extraction took place at 20 km or less from protected territories. Further, 90{\%} of all considered extraction sites correspond to below-average relative water availability, with particularly copper and gold mining occurring in areas with significant water scarcity. Our study has far-reaching implications for future global and local policy and resource management responses to mitigate the negative effects of the expected expansion of metal mining.}

  abstract  = {On a global scale demand for the products of the extractive industries is ever increasing. Extraction of the targeted resource results in the concurrent production of a significant volume of waste material, including tailings, which are mixtures of crushed rock and processing fluids from mills, washeries or concentrators that remain after the extraction of economic metals, minerals, mineral fuels or coal. The volume of tailings is normally far in excess of the liberated resource, and the tailings often contain potentially hazardous contaminants. A priority for a reasonable and responsible mining organization must be to proactively isolate the tailings so as to forestall them from entering groundwaters, rivers, lakes and the wind. There is ample evidence that, should such tailings enter these environments they may contaminate food chains and drinking water. Furthermore, the tailings undergo physical and chemical change after they have been deposited. The chemical changes are most often a function of exposure to atmospheric oxidation and tends to make previously, perhaps safely held contaminants mobile and available. If the tailings are stored under water, contact with the atmosphere is substantially reduced, thereby forestalling oxygen-mediated chemical change. It is therefore accepted practice for tailings to be stored in isolated impoundments under water and behind dams. However, these dams frequently fail, releasing enormous quantities of tailings into river catchments. These accidents pose a serious threat to animal and human health and are of concern for extractive industries and the wider community. It is therefore of importance to understand the nature of the material held within these dams, what best safety practice is for these structures and, should the worst happen, what adverse effects such accidents might have on the wider environment and how these might be mitigated. This paper reviews these factors, covering the characteristics, types and magnitudes, environmental impacts, and remediation of mine tailings dam failures.},

  abstract  = {This paper shows how ethnic identities may become more salient due to natural resources extraction. We combine individual data on the strength of ethnic{\textemdash}relative to national{\textemdash}identities with geo-localised information on the contours of ethnic homelands, and on the timing and location of mineral resources exploitation in 25 African countries, from 2005 to 2015. Our strategy takes advantage of several dimensions of exposure to resources exploitation: time, spatial proximity and ethnic proximity. We find that the strength of an ethnic group identity increases when mineral resource exploitation in that group{'}s historical homeland intensifies. We argue that this result is at least partly rooted in feelings of relative deprivation associated with the exploitation of the resources. We show that such exploitation has limited positive economic spillovers, especially for members of the indigenous ethnic group; and that the link between mineral resources and the salience of ethnic identities is reinforced among members of powerless ethnic groups and groups with strong baseline identity feelings or living in poorer areas, or areas with a history of conflict. Put together, these findings suggest a new dimension of the natural resource curse: the fragmentation of identities, between ethnic groups and nations.},

The rapid advancements in remote sensing technology, particularly through Sentinel-2{'}s high-resolution multispectral imagery, have transformed agricultural monitoring by providing critical data on plant health, soil moisture, and growth patterns. By leveraging Vegetation Indices (VIs) derived from these images, AI algorithms, including Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, can now predict crop yields with high accuracy. This paper reviews studies from the past five years that utilize Sentinel-2 and AI techniques to estimate yields for crops like wheat, maize, rice, and others. Various AI approaches are discussed, including Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and ensemble methods, all contributing to refined yield forecasts. The review identifies a notable gap in the standardization of methodologies, with researchers using different VIs and AI techniques for similar crops, leading to varied results. As such, this study emphasizes the need for comprehensive comparisons and more consistent methodologies in future research. The work underscores the significant role of Sentinel-2 and AI in advancing precision agriculture, offering valuable insights for future studies that aim to enhance sustainability and efficiency in crop management through advanced predictive models.

The higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat allows for satellite-based crop yield mapping even in relatively small scaled agricultural settings such as found in Switzerland and other central European regions. In this study, five years (2017{\textendash}2021) of cereal crop yield data from a combine harvester were used to model crop yield within-field, on a spatial scale corresponding to the Sentinel-2 pixel level. Three established methods from literature using (i-ii) spectral indices and (iii) raw satellite reflectance as well as (iv) a recurrent neural network (RNN) were chosen for analysis. Although the RNN approach did not outperform the other methods, it was more efficient because of the comparatively simple end-to-end training of the model, resulting in much less time spent on data cleaning and feature extraction needed for spectral index time series analysis. The RNN was also able to discriminate cloudy data by itself, reaching similar performance levels as if using pre-processed, cloud-free data. Modelling was performed on individual years, all years combined and on unseen years using leave-one-year-out cross-validation. The models performed best when using data from all years (R2 up to 0.88, relative RMSE up to 10.49 {\%}) and showed poor performance when predicting on unseen data years, especially for years with previously unknown weather patterns. This highlights the importance of yearly model calibration and the need for continuous data collection enabling long time series for future crop yield models.}

In this study, we perform an extensive literature review, and the data show that water pollution in Central Asia is closely linked to human activities. Within the Asian Gold Belt, water pollution is influenced mainly by mining, and the predominant pollutants are heavy metals and radionuclides. However, in the irrigated areas along the middle and lower reaches of inland rivers (e.g., the Amu Darya and Syr Darya), water pollution is strongly associated with agriculture. Hence, irrigated areas are characterized by high concentrations of ammonia, nitrogen, and phosphorus. In addition, the salinities of rivers and groundwater in the middle and lower reaches of inland rivers generally increase along the flow path due to high rates of evaporation. Soil salinization and frequent salt dust storms in the Aral Sea basin further increase the pollution of surface water bodies. Ultimately, the pollution of surface water and groundwater poses risks to human health and deteriorates the ecological environment. To prevent further water pollution, joint monitoring of the surface water and groundwater quantity and quality throughout Central Asia must be implemented immediately.}

Top-down mercury reduction efforts have had limited results, but a bottom-up embrace of cyanide (CN) processing could eventually displace mercury amalgamation for gold recovery. However, ASGM transitions to cyanidation nearly always include an overlap phase, with mercury amalgamation then cyanidation being used sequentially. This paper uses a transdisciplinary approach that combines natural and social sciences to develop a holistic picture of why mercury and cyanide converge in gold processing and potential impacts that may be worse than either practice in isolation. We show that socio-economic factors drive the comingling of mercury and cyanide practices in ASGM as much or more so than technical factors. The resultant Hg-CN complexes have been implicated in increasing the mobility of mercury, compared to elemental mercury used in Hg-only processing. To support future inquiry, we identify key knowledge gaps including the role of Hg-CN complexes in mercury oxidation, transport, and fate, and possible links to mercury methylation. The global extent and increase of mercury and cyanide processing in ASGM underscores the importance of further research. The immediacy of the problem also demands interim policy responses while research advances, though ultimately, the well-documented struggles of mercury reduction efforts in ASGM temper optimism about policy responses to the mercury-cyanide transition.}

The Standard was developed by a multi-disciplinary Expert Panel, with input from a multi-stakeholder Advisory Group. The Standard is further informed by existing best practice and findings from past tailings facility failures. In addition, the Standard underwent a public consultation and commenting period from 15th November until 31st December 2019. The Global Tailings Review team ran a total of 21 workshops with a wide range of stakeholder groups across Australia, Chile, China, Ghana, Kazakhstan and South Africa. The consultation received 202 online and email submissions, as well as responses from in-country workshops consisting of 427 participants. The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management, which is the outcome of the Global Tailings Review process, is an important milestone towards the ambition of zero harm to people and the environment from tailings facilities.  Underpinned by an integrated approach to tailings management, the Standard aims to prevent catastrophic failure and enhance the safety of mine tailings facilities across the globe. It goes beyond existing guidance on the management of tailing facilities addressing crucial issues including: meaningful engagement of project affected people throughout the lifecycle of the mine tailing facility; raising the bar on human rights related requirements; strengthening of environmental protection requirements, including stronger attention to the evolving climate change impacts on mine tailing facilities and to restoration; application of a structured and robust approach to the risk classification of existing and planned facilities; establishing a governance mechanism for the management of tailing facilities, as well as identifying high level responsibility for the implementation of the standard, in direct communication with the Board; public disclosure and transparency of information on mine tailing facilities to stakeholders. Comprising six Topic areas, 15 Principles and 77 auditable Requirements, the Standard will ultimately be supported by implementation protocols that will provide detailed guidance for certification or assurance as applicable, and for equivalence with other standards.},

Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of Cu, Pb, and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment. Copper mining produces extensive mine wastes and tailings and Cu smelting emits approximately 0.11 Mg of S per Mg of Cu produced in the USA. Zinc and Pb smelters release large quantities of Cd and Pb into the environment. Metal smelting and refining produce gaseous (CO2, SO2, NOx, etc.) and particulate matter emissions, sewage waters, and solid wastes. Soil contamination with trace metals is considered a serious problem related to smelting; however, mining and smelting are not main sources of global metal input into soils. Other sources like discarded manufactured products, coal ash, agriculture, and transportation take a lead. Smelters are the main sources of atmospheric emissions of As, Cu, Cd, Sb, and Zn on a global scale and they contribute substantially to the overall emissions of Cr, Pb, Se, and Ni. A quantitative evaluation of the environmental health effects of mining and smelting is difficult because of the complexity of factors involved and lack of consistent methodology. Nevertheless, the case studies described indicate that negative health effects could arise from Pb mining and smelting. Risk assessment revealed that food chain contamination by Cd from soils contaminated by smelting is very unlikely under the western diet.},

Securing and augmenting agricultural yield in times of global warming and population increase is urgent and should, aside from ameliorating saline soils, include attempts to increase crop plant salt tolerance. This short review provides an overview of the processes that limit growth and yield in saline conditions. Yield is reduced if soil salinity surpasses crop-specific thresholds, with cotton, barley and sugar beet being highly tolerant, while sweet potato, wheat and maize display high sensitivity. Apart from Na+, also Cl{-}, Mg2+, SO42- or HCO3- contribute to salt toxicity. The inhibition of biochemical or physiological processes cause imbalance in metabolism and cell signalling and enhance the production of reactive oxygen species interfering with cell redox and energy state. Plant development and root patterning is disturbed, and this response depends on redox and reactive oxygen species signalling, calcium and plant hormones. The interlink of the physiological understanding of tolerance processes from molecular processes as well as the agronomical techniques for stabilizing growth and yield and their interlinks might help improving our crops for future demand and will provide improvement for cultivating crops in saline environment.}

The ability of plants to tolerate salt is determined by multiple biochemical pathways that facilitate retention and/or acquisition of water, protect chloroplast functions, and maintain ion homeostasis. Essential pathways include those that lead to synthesis of osmotically active metabolites, specific proteins, and certain free radical scavenging enzymes that control ion and water flux and support scavenging of oxygen radicals or chaperones. The ability of plants to detoxify radicals under conditions of salt stress is probably the most critical requirement. Many salt-tolerant species accumulate methylated metabolites, which play crucial dual roles as osmoprotectants and as radical scavengers. Their synthesis is correlated with stress-induced enhancement of photorespiration. In this paper, plant responses to salinity stress are reviewed with emphasis on physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance. This review may help in interdisciplinary studies to assess the ecological significance of salt stress.}

We address potentially confounding factors with a difference-in-difference-in-differences strategy that controls for persistent characteristics of schools, years, and attendance periods. Of the pollutants considered, we find that high carbon monoxide (CO) levels, even when below federal air quality standards, significantly increase absences. Our results suggest that the substantial decline in CO levels over the past two decades has yielded economically significant health benefits.},

	abstract = {Mining, although relevant and indispensable for human socioeconomic development, is considered one of the most polluting anthropogenic activities. Water resources are the most vulnerable environmental compartment to the direct impacts of mining, especially in the semi-arid regions. In these regions, mining activity constitutes an important challenge in the management of water resources; since its impacts can be maximized by the adverse meteorological conditions. This study aimed to assess the level of contamination in water resources of three important mining areas in a semi-arid region, where approximately 70,000 people live. The concentrations of eleven heavy metals in sediment, surface and groundwater samples were determined by ICP OES. The results obtained for water samples indicated significant contamination by Cd, Pb, and U, based on the limits established by Brazilian and international regulatory legislation. In the case of sediment samples, higher concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, and V were observed. Pollution indices (PLI, CF and Igeo) revealed moderate to extreme contamination mainly along the Jacar{\'{e}} and Contas rivers. The Pearson correlation, Principal Component, and Hierarchical Cluster analyses were performed to identify patterns in the distribution of elements and common sources of pollution. The results suggested that the concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and V were mainly related to mining activities and, to a lesser extent, natural sources. In the case of Cd and Pb, contamination may have an important contribution from fertilizers use, whereas Zn has a mixed source of both lithogenic and anthropogenic origin. On the other hand, the high concentrations of U, specifically in groundwater samples, were associated with geogenic causes. Although the potential ecological risk values indicated a low ecological risk; other sediment quality indices (TEL, PEL, {$\Sigma$}TU, and PEL-Q) revealed that there is 25{\%} of the probability that the content of heavy metals in water resources near the mining areas induces adverse toxic effects on aquatic organisms.}

	abstract = {Since its advent at the end of the nineteenth century, cyanide processing facilitated the intensification and global expansion of industrial gold mining. Today, there are important indications that artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is on the verge of a similar cyanide revolution: while ASGM is typically associated with mercury-based processing, mercury amalgamation is increasingly replaced with, or complemented by, cyanidation. Relying on evidence from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Burkina Faso, we demonstrate how this transition is having a deeply transformative impact on ASGM communities. On the one hand, cyanidation produces clear efficiency gains. Together with rising gold prices, it is fueling a dramatic expansion of ASGM by enabling the profitable extraction of lower-grade gold deposits. On the other hand, it contributes to the emergence of new and often highly unequal labor and revenue-sharing arrangements. More broadly, these findings demonstrate the highly uneven impact of socio-technical transformations. Consequently, the growing number of efforts to intervene in the technological make-up of ASGM, usually in the name of efficiency and sustainability, should be wary of having unintended consequences.}

In this study, we demonstrate that source partitioning using lead isotopes provide complementary and unique information to concentration gradients to evaluate point-source releases, transport, and recovery of metal mining pollution in the environment. We analyzed eight sediment cores, collected within 24 km of two gold mines, for Pb stable isotopes, Pb concentration, and sediment chronology. Stable Pb isotope ratios (206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) of mining ore were different from those of background (pre-disturbance) sediment, allowing the use of a quantitative mixing model. As previously reported for some Arctic lakes, Pb isotope ratios indicated negligible aerosol inputs to sediment from regional or long-range pollution sources, possibly related to low annual precipitation. Maximum recorded Pb flux at each site reached up to 63 mg m{-}2 yr{-}1 in the period corresponding to early years of mining when pollution mitigation measures were at a minimum (1950s{\textendash}1960s). The maximum contribution of mining-derived Pb to these fluxes declined with distance from the mines from 92 {$\pm$} 8{\%} to 8 {$\pm$} 4{\%} at the farthest site. Mining-derived Pb was still present at the sediment surface within 9 km of Giant Mine more than ten years after mine closure (5{\textendash}26 km, 95{\%} confidence interval) and model estimates suggest it could be present for another {$\sim$}50{\textendash}100 years. These results highlight the persistence of Pb pollution in freshwater sediment and the usefulness of Pb stable isotopes to quantify spatial and temporal trends of contamination from mining pollution, particularly as concentrations approach background.

	           centuries. Regulation of this industry has varied over time and
	           while industrial mining is prevalent in the country, the expansion
	           of artisanal mining, or Galamsey has escalated in recent years.
	           Many of these artisanal mines are not only harmful to human health
	           due to the use of Mercury (Hg) in the amalgamation process, but
	           also leave a significant footprint on terrestrial ecosystems,
	           degrading and destroying forested ecosystems in the region. In this
	           study, the Landsat image archive available through Google Earth
	           Engine was used to quantify the total footprint of vegetation loss
	           due to artisanal gold mines in Ghana from 2005 to 2019 and
	           understand how conversion of forested regions to mining has changed
	           over a decadal period from 2007 to 2017. A combination of machine
	           learning and change detection algorithms were used to calculate
	           different land cover conversions and the timing of conversion
	           annually. Within the study area of southwestern Ghana, our results
	           indicate that approximately 47,000 ha of vegetation were converted
	           to mining at an average rate of { \textasciitilde}2600 ha yr{-}1.
	           The results indicate that a high percentage ({\textasciitilde}50{\%
	           }) of this mining occurred between 2014 and 2017. Around 700 ha of
	           this mining occurred within protected areas as mapped by the World
	           Database of Protected Areas. In addition to deforestation,
	           increased artisanal mining activity in recent years has the
	           potential to affect human health, access to drinking water
	           resources and food security. This work expands upon limited
	           research into the spatial footprint of Galamsey in Ghana,
	           complements mapping efforts by local geographers, and will support
	           efforts by the government of Ghana to monitor deforestation caused
