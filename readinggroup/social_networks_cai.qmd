## Short Overview

. . .

@cai2015 study how **social networks** influence the **decision** by farmers to **take up insurance** against extreme weather events.

:::{.incremental}
* They provide two sets of **information sessions** to farmers, 
  * basic ones to one group,
  * and **intensive information sessions** to another group.
* They show that for farmers who do not receive the intensive session, having [**intensively informed friends**]{.col1} increases the take-up rate.
* This effect is driven by [**knowledge spillovers**]{.col1} rather than simple diffusion of purchase decisions.
* Conducting an additional **price randomization** experiment on village level enables them to quantify the effect of **one additional such friend** as being equivalent to a **13 percent reduction** in the insurance premium.

## Background

:::{.incremental}
* The study concerns **rice farmers** in China, i.e., producers of the most important crop in the country.
* The [**insurance product**]{.col1} is **new**, meaning that farmers and local officials were unaware of its characteristics.
* In China, **village meetings** are a common format of introducing new products or policy and disseminating information about them. [The **information meetings** can be seen in this context.]{.fragment}
* The **fair price** of the insurance is 12 RMB per mu, but it is heavily **subsidized**; farmers pay 3.6 RMB, which is deducted from their main subsidy account.
* Payout is a linear function of the crop loss rate, and maximum payout is 200 RMB. The usual gross income from rice crops is 800 RMB, production cost is 400 RMB.

## Experimental Design

. . .

![](figures/fig11.png)

. . .

In the [**First Round**]{.col1}, households are divided into treated (intensive session) and control (simple session). In the [**Second Round**]{.col2}, farmers are again divided into intensive and simple sessions, and are **then shown** either no, aggregate, or individualized **information** on purchasers of the insurance.

## What do They Find?

:::{.incremental}
* Households are asked to list their **five closest friends**. The **share** of this group invited to first-round intensive session is then the network measure.
* The **take-up rate** in first-round intensive sessions is **14 percentage points higher** than in simple sessions (49 vs. 35 percent).
* Having **one additional friend** who was treated in the first round increases take-up by **5.8 percentage points**, 42 percent of the impact of attending the session oneself.
* People are not influenced by first-round simple session attendees; they are also less influenced if they are educated about insurance.
* The **price randomization** experiment shows that increasing the price by 1 RMB decreases takeup by 12.3 percentage points.
* Having **one additional treated friend** is equivalent in take-up effect to a 13-percent decrease in the average insurance premium.

## What Is the Effect Driven by?

:::{.incremental}
* There are **three potential channels**:
  * People **gain knowledge** about the value of the product from their informed friends,
  * People **learn how to use the product** from their friends, and
  * People learn that their friends **purchased** the product and copy their decisions.
* Using the accompanying survey, @cai2015 estimate the knowledge spillover effect and find that people who were informed by friends after the first round have a comparable level of knowledge to their informed friends.
* As for whether purchase decisions diffuse by themselves, they found that only if information on overall take-up rate or on which friends purchased the product is **disseminated** to farmers are they influenced by their friends' decisions — if no information is provided, take-up rate among friends had no effect.
